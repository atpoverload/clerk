# `clerk`

`clerk` is a data collection framework for `Java` with access to the [`Supplier`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/function/Supplier.html) interface. The API decomposes the development work into sources and processors while supporting various data collection policies. `clerk` uses a [dependency injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection)-like model to enforce correctness.

`clerk` can be added to your project the following ways:
 - build a jar using make
 - dependency for `bazel`
