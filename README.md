# `clerk`

`clerk` is a generalized data collection framework for `Java`. `clerk` simplifies construction of data pipelines by decomposing the procedure into sources and processing while providing structural tools to connect them easily. The framework can be used with vanilla Java or [dagger](https://dagger.dev/).
